    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>The report that demobilisation will be completed by March
    31st is now officially denied. There would appear to be
    something in the rumour that the Demobilisation Staff have
    expressed the hope of dying in harness.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is stated that Woolwich Arsenal is preparing to
    manufacture ice-cream freezers. People are wondering if it was
    the weather that gave them this happy thought.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The German ex-Crown Prince is so determined that the Allies
    shall not place him on trial that he now threatens to commit
    suicide or die in the attempt.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"There are things we want to get rid of," says "BACK
    BENCHER" in <i>The Daily Mail</i>. The rumour that Sir
    FREDERICK BANBURY, M.P., has already demanded an apology is
    unconfirmed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Soldier-golfers, says a sporting writer, are already urging
    the introduction of fresh features into the game. A new method
    of addressing the ball, introduced from Mesopotamia, is said to
    be most efficacious.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>With reference to the North of England man who has decided
    not to strike, we now learn that he happens to be out of work
    just at present.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>ISAAC DENBIGH, of Chicago, is, we are told,
    one-hundred-and-thirteen years of age. He must try again. We
    expect better things than this from America.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Statesmen, says Sir WILLIAM ORPEN, A.R.A., are poor sitters.
    The impulse to rush out and cackle has probably something to do
    with it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is said that a soldier in the Lancashire Fusiliers
    decided, on being demobilised, to accept a standard civilian
    suit instead of the usual gratuity. The Sergeant-Major in
    charge of the case lies in a critical condition.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Sand-gleaners at Ramsgate are making money from bags of
    sugar washed ashore. This answers the oft-propounded question,
    "How do grocers spend their week-ends?"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Another hold-up by American soldiers has occurred in
    Liverpool. In view of the magnitude of our debt to the United
    States it is felt that this method of collecting it in
    instalments is bound to prove unsatisfactory.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Humour and love," says a contemporary, "are what will pay
    the average writer best at the moment." It is not known whether
    Labour or the Peace Conference has done most to send up the
    price of these luxuries.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Officials of the Waiters' Union are perturbed over the
    rumour that restaurant <i>habitués</i> are preparing to strike
    in favour of a fifty per cent. reduction in tips.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Several of our leading magistrates declare that unless some
    High Court judge asks, "What is beer?" they will be compelled
    to do it themselves.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A St. Bernard dog belonging to a New York hotel-keeper
    perished after swallowing a bundle of dollar notes. It is said
    that the deceased died worth sixty-five pounds.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>One explanation for the many daylight robberies committed
    recently in London is that several of our better-class burglars
    object to breaking into people's houses like thieves in the
    night.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Because a Highgate lodger refused to pay his rent, the
    landlady wrote asking his wife to come and fetch him away. If
    he is not claimed in three days he will be sold to defray
    expenses.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Only a person with a perfectly healthy skin, says a
    contemporary, can afford to face the keen winds without taking
    precaution. If you have any doubts about your skin the best
    thing is to leave it at home on the hat-rack.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At a football match at South Hindley last week the referee
    was struck in the mouth and severely injured by one of the
    backs, after ordering three other players off the field for
    fighting. This, we understand, was one of the first fixtures to
    be brought off under the auspices of the Brighter Football
    League.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The L.C.C. are said to be formulating a plan to meet the
    rush for trains on the Underground. Personally we always try to
    avoid it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A medical journal refers to a new method of raising blisters
    by hypnotic suggestion. This is said to be an improvement on
    the old East End system of developing black eyes by
    back-answering.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A defendant told the Tower Bridge magistrate that he only
    took whisky when he had a cold. It must be hard work for him to
    resist sitting by an open window this weather.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A gold vase, said to have been stolen from Assyria 2478
    years ago, has just been found in a sarcophagus at Cairo. We
    understand that the local police have been instructed to take
    action.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The typist who, as reported in these columns last week, fell
    out of a moving train on the Isle of Wight Railway and had
    quite a lot to say to the guard when she overtook the train, is
    now understood to have been told she could keep on walking if
    she liked. However, as her people were not expecting her until
    the train arrived, she again entered the carriage from which
    she had fallen.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Russian soldiers are now permitted to smoke in the streets
    and to travel in railway carriages. Later on it is hoped that
    the privilege of dying a natural death may be extended to
    them.</p>

    <h2>CAST.</h2>

    <p>The auctioneer glanced at his book. "Number 29," he said,
    "black mare, aged, blind in near eye, otherwise sound."</p>

    <p>The cold rain and the biting north-east wind did not add to
    the appearance of Number 29, as she stood, dejected, listless,
    with head drooping, in the centre of the farmers and
    horse-dealers who were attending the sale of cast Army horses.
    She looked as though she realised that her day had waned, and
    that the bright steel work, the soft well-greased leather, the
    snowy head-rope and the shining curb were to be put aside for
    less noble trappings.</p>

    <p>She had a curiously shaped white blaze, and I think it was
    that, added to the description of her blindness, which stirred
    my memory within me. I closed my eyes for a second and it all
    came back to me, the gun stuck in the mud, the men straining at
    the wheels, the shells bursting, the reek of high explosive,
    the two leaders lying dead on the road, and, above all, two
    gallant horses doing the work of four and pulling till you'd
    think their hearts would burst.</p>

    <p>I stepped forward and, looking closer at the mare's neck,
    found what I had expected, a great scar. That settled it. I
    approached the auctioneer and asked permission to speak to the
    crowd for a few moments.</p>

    <p>"Well," said he, "I'm supposed to do the talking here, you
    know."</p>

    <p>"It won't do you any harm," I pleaded, "and it will give me
    a chance to pay off a big debt."</p>

    <p>"Right," he said, smiling; "carry on."</p>

    <p>"Gentlemen," I said, "about this time a year ago I was
    commanding a battery in France. It was during the bad days, and
    we were falling back with the Hun pressing hard upon us. My
    guns had been firing all the morning from a sunken road, when
    we got orders to limber up and get back to a rear position. We
    hadn't had a bad time till then, a few odd shells, but nothing
    that was meant especially for our benefit. And then, just as we
    were getting away, they spotted us, and a battery opened on us
    good and strong. By a mixture of good luck and great effort
    we'd got all the guns away but one, when a shell landed just in
    front of the leaders and knocked them both out with their
    driver; at the same time the gun was jerked off the road into a
    muddy ditch. Almost simultaneously another shell killed one of
    the wheelers, and there we were with one horse left to get the
    gun out of the ditch and along a road that was almost as bad as
    the ditch itself.</p>

    <p>"It looked hopeless, and it was on the tip of my tongue to
    give orders to abandon the gun, when suddenly out of the blue
    there appeared on the bank above us a horse, looking
    unconcernedly down at us.</p>

    <p>"In those days loose horses were straying all over the
    country, and I took this to be one from another battery which
    had come to us for company.</p>

    <p>"I turned to one of the men. 'Catch that mare quick.'</p>

    <p>"In a few minutes we had the harness off the dead wheeler
    and on the new-comer. Pull? Gentlemen, if you could have seen
    those two horses pull!</p>

    <p>"We'd just got a move on the gun when another shell came and
    seemed to burst right on top of the strange mare. I heard a
    terrified squeal, and through the smoke I saw her stagger and
    with a mighty effort recover herself. I ran round and saw she'd
    been badly hit over the eye and had a great tearing gash in the
    neck. We never thought she could go on, but she pulled away
    just the same, with the blood pouring off her, till finally we
    got the gun out and down the road to safety.</p>

    <p>"I got knocked out a few minutes later, and from that day to
    this I've often wondered what had happened to the mare that had
    served us so gallantly. I know now. There she stands before
    you. I'd know her out of a thousand by the white blaze; and if
    there was a doubt there's her blind eye and the scar on her
    neck.</p>

    <p>"That's all, gentlemen; but I'm going to ask the man who
    buys her to remember her story and to see that her last days
    are not too hard."</p>

    <p>She fell at a good price to a splendid type of West Country
    farmer, and the auctioneer whispered to me, "I'm glad old
    Carey's got her. There's not a man in the county keeps his
    horses better."</p>

    <p>"Old Carey" came up to me as we were moving off. "I had a
    son in France," he said, "in the gunners, too, but he hadn't
    the luck of the old mare"&mdash;he hesitated a moment and his
    old eyes looked steadily into mine&mdash;"for he'll never come
    back. The mare'll be all right, Sir," he went on as he walked
    off, "easy work and full rations. I reckon she's earned
    them."</p>

    <h2>THE ACUTE ANGLER.</h2>

    <p>The Colonel of our Reserve Battalion has an almost unique
    reputation as an angler. Scattered elements of the regiment
    carry his piscatorial heroics to obscure corners of the earth.
    Majors on the Pushti Kuli range recount the episode of the
    ingenuous troutling which, having apparently conceived a
    violent passion for the Colonel, literally forced itself upon
    the hook seven times within a short afternoon. Captains on the
    Sultanitza Planina rehearse the epic incidents of how the
    Colonel snatched victory from defeat after pursuing for three
    miles an infuriated pike which had wrenched the very rod from
    his grasp. Subalterns in the chill wilds of Cologne, adding
    picturesque details to an already artistic story, relate how he
    hooked a mighty veteran carp near Windsor, and played it for
    nine full hours (with a rest of ten minutes after the first,
    and five after each successive hour); how, under a full moon,
    he eventually grounded it on the Blackfriars' mud and beached
    it with a last effort; how they lay panting side by side for a
    space, and how, finally, with the courtesy due to an honourable
    foe from a gallant victor, he forced neat brandy down its
    throat and returned it to its domain in a slightly inebriated
    but wholly grateful condition.</p>

    <p>Consequently the Colonel's announcement that in view of the
    armistice he intended to spend three days in fishing the waters
    of a friend's estate was received by the Mess with lively
    satisfaction. An overwhelming fish diet was deprecated, but it
    was generally held that the honour of the regiment was in some
    way involved, and the Major felt it his duty to escort his
    senior officer on an expedition of such gravity.</p>

    <p>It transpired that the first day was unfortunate. The
    Colonel was silently impolite throughout Mess and retired
    immediately afterwards. The Major explained that the conditions
    had been adverse. The punt leaked at the end depressed by the
    Colonel and the ground-bait had been left behind. The wind was
    fierce and cutting, and the brandlings had been upset into the
    luncheon-basket. In addition the Colonel's reel had escaped
    into the river and had declined to give itself up until the
    whole length of line had been hauled in; and, in leaning over
    the side to reclaim it, his gold fountain-pen had vanished.
    Five hooks had failed to return from the deep and two were left
    suspended from inaccessible branches; Also in the Major's
    opinion there was not a single fish in the river.</p>

    <p>By breakfast the Colonel had regained his spirits. He
    commented on the lack of support given him by the Major, and in
    his place invited the Adjutant on the ground that he was
    probably less clumsy. He remarked that the offensive had not
    yet opened and that the previous day had been mainly devoted to
    a thorough reconnaissance of the whole sector. He had reason to
    believe that the enemy was present in considerable force.</p>

    <p>The second day proved equally unfortunate. The Colonel took
    his dinner in private, and the Mess orderly, who had dismally
    cut the two of clubs in the kitchen, returned from his
    ministrations a complete nervous wreck. The Adjutant explained
    that misfortune had followed misfortune. They had barely
    settled down midstream, and he was in the act of extracting a
    hook from the Colonel's finger with his jack-knife, when the
    punt broke from its moorings and carried them half-a-mile
    downstream. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
       id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> It was uncanny how the
       craft had contrived to navigate four bends without giving an
       opportunity of landing. In the afternoon they had fished
       from the bank, and the Colonel had fallen asleep while the
       Adjutant mounted guard. The Adjutant protested that it was
       not his fault that the float suddenly disappeared, or that
       the Colonel, on being vigorously awakened by him, struck so
       violently at what proved to be a dead branch that he lost
       his footing and tobogganned heavily into the river, and was
       compelled to waste three hours in the neighbouring hostelry
       taking precautions against a chill.</p>

    <p>At breakfast next morning the Colonel intimated that on this
    his last day he would go unaccompanied. With one eye on the
    Major and the other on the Adjutant, he passed a few remarks on
    the <i>finesse</i> of fishing. The element of surprise should
    be the basis of attack. Precision and absolute secrecy in the
    carrying out of preliminary operations was vital. Every trick
    and every device of camouflage should be brought into play.
    There should be no violent preliminary bombardment of
    ground-bait to alarm the hostile forces, but the sector should
    be unostentatiously registered on the preceding night. The
    enemy's first realisation of attack should be at that moment
    when resistance was futile&mdash;though for his part he
    preferred a foe that would fight to the fish-basket, as it
    were. He thought the weather was vastly improved and admitted
    that his hopes were high.</p>

    <p>In the evening the Colonel positively swaggered into Mess.
    He radiated good fellowship and even bandied witticisms with
    the junior subaltern in an admirable spirit of give-and-take.
    He had enjoyed excellent sport. Later, in the ante-room, he
    delivered a useful little homily on the surmounting of
    obstacles, on patience, on presence of mind and on nerve,
    copiously illustrated from a day's triumph that will resound on
    the Murman coast as the unconditional surrender of the
    intimidated roach. He described how he had cunningly
    outmanoeuvred the patrols, defeated the vigilance of the
    pickets, pierced the line of resistance, launched a surprise
    attack on the main body, and spread panic in the hearts of the
    hostile legions.</p>

    <p>Unhappily for us, common decency, he said, had forced him to
    present his catch to his friend.</p>

    <h2>THE TWOPENNY BIN.</h2>

    <p>It was called <i>Greatheart</i>; or, <i>Samuel's Sentimental
    Side</i>; and I think you will agree that it was a lot of title
    for twopence. Day after day, as I fumbled among the old books
    in the Twopenny Bin of the little secondhand bookseller's shop,
    that volume would wriggle itself forward and worm its way into
    my hands; and I would clench my teeth and thrust it to the
    remotest depths of the box.</p>

    <p>Then it haunted me. All day in my room I could hear
    <i>Greatheart</i>; or, <i>Samuel's Sentimental Side</i> calling
    out to me, "How would you like to be in the Twopenny Bin?"</p>

    <p>I began to grow sentimental myself, and to handle those
    unconsidered trifles with tenderness. For you never know; I
    might be in the Twopenny Bin myself someday; might be picked
    up, just glanced at and shifted back into the corner out of
    sight.</p>

    <p>Yesterday <i>Greatheart</i> again found himself in my hands,
    and I looked to see the date of his entry upon the world. I
    reflected on his sixty years of life, on the many happy
    fireside hours that had been spent in his company, on the
    gentle solace he had furnished to lesser hearts.</p>

    <p>I had decided what to do. There were few people about; the
    bookseller was not looking, and, if offence it was, well, I
    could fall back on the mercy of those who would judge.</p>

    <p>I leaned forward and tenderly deposited him in the Fourpenny
    Bin.</p>

    <h2>A CONTRA APPRECIATION.</h2>

    <p>LORD NORTHCLIFFE has recently contributed a remarkably
    outspoken criticism of Mr. LLOYD GEORGE by way of "send-off" to
    his latest journal, <i>The New Illustrated</i>. The following
    extracts from an article about to appear in <i>The Pacific
    Monthly</i>, kindly communicated to us by wireless, seem to
    indicate that the PREMIER is indisposed to take it lying
    down:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"In a letter recently published without my authority I said
    that I was unable to control or influence him. This was true at
    the time and remains true now. Time and again have efforts been
    made to harness his energies to the State, but they have never
    succeeded. The responsibilities of office are irksome to his
    imperious temperament. There is something almost tragic in a
    figure, equipped with the qualities of an hereditary autocrat,
    endeavouring to accommodate himself to the needs of a
    democracy. The spectacle of this purple Emperor of the Press,
    with his ear constantly glued to the ground, is not wanting in
    pathos. With him the idols of yesterday are the pet aversions
    of to-day. He denounces me as 'a political chameleon, taking on
    the colour of those who at the moment happen to be his
    associates.' But what are you to say of a man who clamours for
    a saviour of the situation and then turns him into a cock-shy;
    of a Napoleon who is continually retiring to Elba when things
    are not going as he likes; of a politician who claims the
    privileges but refuses the duties of a Dictator?</p>

    <p>"It is obvious that he is still labouring under the
    hallucination that the War was a duel between him and the
    KAISER; that he 'downed' his antagonist single-handed, and that
    the prospects of a stable peace have been shattered by my
    failure to include him among the British Peace Delegates. So,
    all in a moment, the 'Welsh Wizard' is converted into the
    miserable creature of the Tory Junkers&mdash;a man without
    'high moral courage,' 'wide knowledge' or 'large ideas.'</p>

    <p>"Personally I have no illusions about my consistency, but I
    <i>do</i> think that here I displayed some moral courage, also
    some unselfish consideration for CLEMENCEAU and WILSON and
    others. Just think of the panegyrics that would have been
    showered upon my head in the Press which he controls if he had
    been invited to the Table!</p>

    <p>"But with all deductions he is a man to be reckoned with, if
    not counted upon. He is a man of large type&mdash;almost of
    "Pica" type. And sometimes he deviates into sound and just
    criticism; as for example when he says that I 'depend greatly,
    upon others.' It is true. What is more, I know on whom I can
    depend; and I have learnt that his support can only be secured
    on terms which would reduce the PREMIER to the level of one of
    his minor editors."</p>

    <h2><i>NOUVELLES DE PARIS.</i></h2>

    <h4>(<i>With acknowledgments to the "Society" Press</i>).</h4>

    <p class="author"><i>Paris, Feb., 1919.</i></p>

    <p>Dearest POPPY,&mdash;<i>Que la vie est drôle!</i> Who was it
    said that there are two great tragedies in life&mdash;not
    getting what you want, and getting it? I never understood that
    saying until now. For instance, when I left London most people
    I knew seemed to have a feverish desire to get to Paris. They
    were ready to move heaven, earth and the Ministry of
    Information to obtain the desired passport. They would go to
    any lengths to prove how necessary their presence is here
    during the Peace Conference.</p>

    <p>And now I find my countrymen over here longing with an equal
    feverishness to go home again. <i>Ils s'attristent. Ils
    s'ennuient.</i> They have <i>nostalgie</i> in its acutest form.
    It quite goes to my heart to hear the pathetic questions they
    put to newcomers: "How is London looking? What shows are
    running now?" And they go on to speak of dear dirty dark
    London, its beloved fogs, how adorable is the atrocious climate
    of England, in a way that would bring tears to your eyes. Why
    <i>don't</i> they go back? you ask, <i>ma chère</i>. It's just
    because they want to be "in at the death" and say they were
    here when <i>la paix était signée</i>.</p>

    <p>So these poor exiles continue to sacrifice themselves and
    drift aimlessly about Paris, making it so full that there's
    scarcely room for people like myself&mdash;who really
    <i>are</i> on important work here&mdash;to breathe.</p>

    <p>Imagine! I met Eleanor Dashgood on the Boulevard Haussmann
    to-day, descending from her car with her two poms yapping at
    her heels, just as if she were <i>chez elle</i>. I really felt
    like saying something pointed; but, after all, my only comment
    was, "My dear, what a <i>strange</i> lot of people one meets in
    Paris nowadays!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, dearest," she said, "that just occurred to me, too."
    I'm wondering now what the creature meant. Believe me, my dear,
    that woman has illegally wangled a passport out of the
    authorities by representing herself as her husband's
    typist&mdash;he's got a diplomatic passport, you know. I
    inquired if the maid she had brought with her had turned into a
    typist, too, to say nothing of the poms. The <i>toupet</i> of
    some people!</p>

    <p>And, of course, all this unnecessary rabble is helping to
    make everything <i>horriblement cher</i>. The price of things
    makes one's hair stand on end like the quills of the fretful
    porcupine. I can assure you that <i>le moindre petit dîner
    coûte les yeux de la tête</i>. Poor Bobbie Lacklands had a
    <i>tragic</i> experience yesterday. He said he quite
    unthinkingly dropped into that most <i>recherché</i> of eating
    places, Fouquet's, for a snack. With only a modest balance at
    the bank he ordered a sardine. Then he called for a <i>filet
    mignon</i> and half-a-pint of <i>vin rouge</i>&mdash;he was
    always a reckless spendthrift sort of boy, you know. A cup of
    <i>café noir</i> and an apple completed his financial ruin.</p>

    <p>But he still declares that they were most awfully decent to
    him about it. They agreed, with scarcely any trouble, to take
    all the notes and loose silver he had with him on account. They

    <p>Paris is beginning to think of dress once more, or I ought
    to say undress, for with the skirts short and the sleeves short
    and the bodice low there isn't <i>very</i> much left to write
    about. I hope these short tight skirts will reach the ankles
    before they reach England, for I notice the people who have the
    courage to wear them generally lack the excuse of symmetry.</p>

    <p><i>Figurez-vous!</i> Jenny Bounceley, who considers herself
    quite a <i>Parisienne</i> now she's got her official <i>carte
    d'alimentation</i>, appeared the other day in a skirt that
    resembled the <i>jupe</i> of a <i>gamine</i>. I think it's
    disgraceful in one of her age and proportions. If she were
    simply knock-kneed; but, as Bertie says, she's knock-ankled as
    well.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 11th</i>.&mdash;The KING's Speech
    outlined a programme of legislation which would in the ordinary
    way occupy two or three Sessions. But the Parliamentary
    machinery is to be ruthlessly speeded up and "a short cut to
    the Millennium" is to be discovered by way of the
    Committee-rooms. Precisians observed with regret that the
    customary reference in the Speech to "economy" had by some
    oversight been omitted; and the prospective creation of several
    additional Departments led Lord CREWE to express apprehension
    lest the country should be "doped" with new Ministries, to the
    detriment of the national health.</p>

        <h4>THE OPPOSITION FREAK.</h4>THE ADAMSON-MACLEAN
        COMBINATION.
    </div>

    <p>"Where are they gone, the old familiar faces?" was the
    question one asked oneself on looking at the crowded benches of
    the House of Commons. It was said of a Past President of the
    United States that he was the politest man in America&mdash;"he
    gave up his seat in a street-car and made room for four
    ladies." The gap made on the Front Opposition Bench by the
    involuntary retirement of Mr. ASQUITH&mdash;to which generous
    allusion was made by the PRIME MINISTER&mdash;is so vast that
    the joint efforts of Sir DONALD MACLEAN and Mr. ADAMSON to fill
    it met with only partial success. Unless, by the way, Mr.
    SPEAKER definitely decides the problem of precedence, it is to
    be feared that the hoped-for acceleration of business will not
    occur, for at present each of them thinks it necessary to speak
    whenever the other does, like the hungry lions on Afric's
    burning shore. For all their outward politeness I am sure "the
    first lion thinks the last a bore"; and if they insist on
    roaring together much longer the House will think it of both of
    them.</p>

    <p>The corner-seat whence Mr. PRINGLE flung his barbed darts at
    the Government is filled, physically, by Mr. STANTON. Lonely
    Mr. HOGGE now sits uneasily upon the Front Opposition Bench,
    but, fearing perhaps lest its dignified traditions should cramp
    his style, makes frequent visits to the Lobby.</p>

    <p>In accordance with ancient custom Sir COURTENAY ILBERT
    asserted the right of the House to initiate legislation by
    calling out "Outlawries Bill" in the middle of the SPEAKER's
    recital of the Sessional Orders. Some of the new Members, I
    fancy, took the interruption seriously, and thought that this
    was the outcome of the "Punish the KAISER." movement.</p>

    <p>The Mover and Seconder of the Address fully deserved the
    customary compliments. Col. Sir RHYS WILLIAMS' quiet and
    effective style explained his success as a picker-up of
    recruits; while Lt.-Commander DEAN, V.C., though he faced the
    House with much more trepidation than he did the batteries of
    Zeebrugge, got well home at the finish.</p>

             CHAMPION.
    </div>

    <p>The lot of a Labour leader just now is not a happy one.
    Perhaps that accounted for the querulous tone assumed by Mr.
    ADAMSON, who seemed more concerned with the omissions in the
    KING's Speech than with its contents. His best sayings were
    imported from America, but he would have done better to content
    himself with LINCOLN and abjure BRYAN, whose "cross-of-gold"
    fustian will not bear repetition.</p>

    <p>After Sir DONALD MACLEAN had thoughtfully provided a welcome
    tea interval the PRIME MINISTER rose to reply to his critics.
    The accusation that he had forgotten some of his recent
    promises, such as "No Conscription," "Punish the Kaiser," and
    "Germany must pay," did not trouble him much. If these
    election-eggs had hatched out prematurely and the contents were
    coming home to roost at an inconvenient moment he had no time
    to attend to them. What the country most needs at the moment is
    a firm clear statement on the Labour troubles, and that is what
    it got. So far as those troubles are due to remediable causes
    they shall be remedied; so far as the demands of Labour are
    based upon class-greed they shall be fought tooth and nail.
    There were a few dissentient shouts from the Opposition
    Benches, but the House as a whole was delighted when the
    PREMIER in ringing tones declared that "no section, however
    powerful, will be allowed to hold up the whole nation."</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 12th</i>.&mdash;The Lords had a brisk
    little debate on agriculture. Lord LINCOLNSHIRE paid many
    compliments to Lord ERNLE for what he had accomplished as Mr.
    PROTHERO, but could not understand why, having exchanged the
    green benches for the red, he should have reversed his old
    policy, "scrapped" the agricultural committees and begun to
    dispose of his tractors. Lord ERNLE, in the measured tones so
    suitable to the Upper House, made a good defence of the change.
    The chief thing wanted now was to "clean the land," where
    noxious weeds, the Bolshevists of the soil, had been spreading
    with great rapidity. As for the tractors, the Board thought it
    a good thing that the farmers should possess their own, but
    would retain in its own hands enough of them to help farmers
    who could not help themselves&mdash;not a large class, I
    imagine, with produce at its present prices.</p>

    <p>In the Commons an hour was spent in discussing the
    Government's now customary motion to take all the time of the
    House. Up got Mr. ADAMSON, to denounce it, now the War was
    over, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"
       id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span> as sheer Kaiserism. Up got
       Sir DONALD MACLEAN to defend it as commonsense, though he
       induced Mr. BONAR LAW to limit its duration to the end of
       March. Colonel WEDGWOOD pleaded that private Members might
       still be allowed to bring in Bills under the Ten Minutes'
       Rule; but that Parliamentary pundit, Sir F. BANBURY,
       asserted that there was no such thing in reality as the Ten
       Minutes' Rule, and pictured the possibility of whole days
       being swallowed up by a succession of private Members
       commending their legislative bantlings one after another
       with the brief explanatory statement permitted on such
       occasions. Alarmed at the prospect Mr. LAW decided not to
       admit the thin end of the WEDGWOOD.</p>

    <p>The debate on the Address was resumed by Mr. BOTTOMLEY, who
    had a large audience. During his previous membership,
    terminated by one of those periodical visits to the Law Courts
    to which he made humorous reference, he delivered some capital
    speeches; and it was pleasant to find that the necessity of
    constantly producing "another powerful article next week" has
    not caused him to lose his oratorical form. His gestures are
    slightly reminiscent of the action of the common pump-handle,
    but his voice is excellent, and his matter has the merit of
    exactly resembling what our old friend "the Man in the Street"
    would say in less Parliamentary language, He has no
    hesitations, for example, on the subject of making Germany pay.
    By one of those rapid financial calculations for which he is
    renowned he has arrived at the comfortable figure of ten
    thousand millions sterling as Britain's little bill; and if you
    express doubts as to the debtor's capacity to pay he replies
    that he cannot recall any judge who made an order against him
    ever prefacing his judgment with an inquiry whether it would be
    convenient for him to find the money.</p>

    <p>Payment in kind is Mr. RONALD McNEILL's prescription. Let
    Leipzig library replenish the empty shelves of Louvain and the
    windows of Cologne make good&mdash;so far as German glass can
    do it&mdash;the shattered glories of Rheims.</p>

    <p>Mr. CLYNES warned the Government against neglecting the
    legitimate aspirations of Labour, one of which, he had the
    courage to affirm, was access to more and better beer. He also
    sought a clear statement of the Government's policy in Russia.
    This request was repeated by Sir SAMUEL HOARE, who, having
    spent a year and a half during the War in that distracted
    country, declared that "we must decide between Bolshevists and
    anti-Bolshevists." Unfortunately that is exactly what,
    according to the PRIME MINISTER's reply, we cannot do. The
    Allies are not prepared to intervene in force; they cannot
    leave Russia to stew in Her own hell-broth. The proposed
    Conference is admittedly a <i>pis-aller</i>; and, if it ever
    meets, no one can feel very hopeful of a tangible result from
    the deliberations of the Prinkipotentiaries.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, February 13th</i>.&mdash;Labour unrest produced
    a capital debate, in which Mr. BRACE, Mr. THOMAS and Mr. SEXTON
    made excellent speeches on the one side, and Major TRYON, Mr.
    REMER (an employer and a profit-sharer) and Mr. BONAR LAW were
    equally effective on the other. Brushing aside minor causes the
    Leader of the House, in his forthright manner, said the root of
    the matter was that "Labour wants a larger share of the good
    things which are to be obtained in this world"&mdash;not an
    unreasonable desire, he indicated, but one which would not be
    permanently realised by strikes directed against the whole
    community. Mr. SEDDON, of the National Democratic Party,
    compressed the same argument into an epigram. If the miners'
    full demands were conceded they would have "an El Dorado for
    one minute and disaster the next."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>FROST AND THAW.</h2>

    <p>I was earlier than usual that morning, which was bad luck,
    as I heard Fitz-Jones click his gate behind me and thud after
    me in his snow-boots. Fitz-Jones and I had a little
    disagreement, not long ago, about the sole possession of a
    servant-maid. Since then there has been a coolness. Curiously
    enough, the hideous frost that raged at the moment (the
    thermometer stood at twenty-five degrees in the henhouse)
    seemed to thaw Fitz-Jones. And I knew why.</p>

    <p>Last summer Fitz-Jones had spent four torrid days with the
    thermometer at 75 degrees, winding up his pipes in straw
    "against" the winter. I had seen his purple face as I hammocked
    it with an iced drink. He had seen and heard me laugh.</p>

    <p>"Ah," he croaked, "you may laugh on the other side of the
    hedge now, but you'll laugh on the other side of your face
    later."</p>

    <p>So now I knew that he was thudding after me in the snow,
    bursting to hear that my pipes had burst or were about to
    burst.</p>

    <p>"Hallo, Browne," he began, "how'd you like this?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, all right," I said airily. Here I did a wonderful step.
    Slide on the right heel&mdash;hesitation shuffle on the left
    toe&mdash;two half slips sideways. Wave both
    arms&mdash;backward bend. Recover.
    Jazz&mdash;tangle&mdash;tickle-toe was nothing to it.</p>

    <p>"Slippery, isn't it?" he said. "My flannel was frozen to the
    wash-stand to-day&mdash;had to get it off with a chisel."</p>

    <p>I was prepared for these travellers' tales. I knew he was
    leading up to water-pipes.</p>

    <p>"Couldn't get my cold tub," he went on; "frozen solid
    overnight."</p>

    <p>I had heard of this cold tub before. "My tooth-brush froze
    on to my teeth," I capped him; "the teapot spout was hung with
    icicles, and the cat's tongue froze on to the milk when it was
    drinking."</p>

    <p>"How about your pipes?" he began, "Who was right about
    wrapping?"</p>

    <p>"Rapping," I said in well-feigned innocence&mdash;"rapping?
    Who rapped? Rapped on what?"</p>

    <p>That set him going.</p>

    <p>I gathered when we reached the station there was a strike
    on. But we found a milk-lorry travelling our way. So Smith had
    the entire use of my right ear into which to say, "I told
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"
       id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span> you so," for an hour, while
       we travelled to the spot on which we win our bread. He had
       dragged from me the fact that our hot-water tap had also
       struck. The milk cans clattered. Smith chattered. So did my
       teeth.</p>

    <p>When I got home that night our house seemed to be more
    handsomely garnished with icicles than any other house I had
    seen that day.</p>

    <p>"Keep the home fires burning!" I said to my wife on
    entering. "If need be, burn the banisters and the bills and my
    boot-trees and everything else beginning with a 'b.' Keep us
    thawed and unburst, or Fitz-Jones will feel he has scored a
    moral victory; he will strut cross-gartered, with yellow
    stockings, for the rest of his days."</p>

    <p>"I don't know what you are talking about," said Evangeline,
    "but Christabel and I" (Christabel is our general-in-command)
    "have been cosseting those pipes all day. Been giving them
    glasses of hot water and dressing them up in all our clothes.
    The bath-pipe is wearing my new furs and your pyjamas, and I've
    put your golf stockings on the geyser-pipe. I expect they'll
    all blow up. Come and look at the hot-water cistern."</p>

    <p>The cistern looked dressy in Evangeline's fur coat. I added
    my silk hat to the geyser's cosy costume and a pair of boots on
    the bath-taps. But I was told not to be silly, so took them off
    again.</p>

    <p>I suggested that the geyser should go to a fancy-dress ball
    as "The Winter of our Discontent," but was again told not to be
    silly.</p>

    <p>Two days elapsed. The frost held. Then something happened.
    Fitz-Jones's lady-help came round at 7.30 A.M. to borrow a drop
    of water, as they were frozen up.</p>

    <p>We lent them several drops, and I breathed again, and
    continued to breathe, with snorts of derision.</p>

    <p>Three days later the thaw came.</p>

    <p>As I passed Fitz-Jones's house I was grieved to hear a
    splashing sound. A cascade of water was spouting from his
    bathroom window. Fitz-Jones himself was running round and round
    the house like a madman, flourishing a water-key and trying to
    find the tap to the main.</p>

    <p>I begged him to be calm, to control himself for his wife's
    sake, for all our sakes. I was most graceful and sympathetic
    about it.</p>

    <p>But with the thaw Fitz-Jones had frozen again.</p>

    <h2>CUE TYPES.</h2>

    <p>At the present moment, when the billiard professionals are
    contesting the palm and Mr. S.H. FRY has re-captured the title
    of amateur champion seven-and-twenty years after he first won
    it, there is such interest in the game that a kind of <i>Guide
    to Billiard Types</i> cannot but be of value. Hence the
    following classification of players who are to be met with in
    clubs, country-houses or saloons by any ordinary wielders of
    the cue. Any reader who has ever endeavoured to master what may
    be called (by way of inversion) the Three Balls Art has power
    to add to their number.</p>

    <p>The player who, as he drops behind in the game, says so
    often that it is months since h" touched a cue that your
    success is robbed of all savour.</p>

    <p>The player who is funny and calls the red the Cherry, the
    Robin, the Cardinal or the Lobster.</p>

    <p>The player who comes to the game as to a solemn ritual and
    neither smiles nor speaks.</p>

    <p>The player who keeps on changing his cue and blames each one
    in turn for his own ineptitude.</p>

    <p>The player who can use his left hand as well as his right: a
    man to be avoided.</p>

    <p>The player who whistles while he plays. This is a very
    deadly companion.</p>

    <p>The player who never has a good word for his opponent's
    efforts.</p>

    <p>The player who congratulates you on every stroke: a charming
    antagonist.</p>

    <p>The player who is always jolly whatever buffets he receives
    from fortune.</p>

    <p>The player who talks about every one of his strokes.</p>

    <p>The player who swears at most of them.</p>

    <p>The player who doubts the accuracy of your scoring. Avoid
    this one.</p>

    <p>The player who hits everything too hard. This is a very
    exasperating man to meet because fortune usually favours him.
    Either he flukes immoderately or he does not leave well. He is
    usually a hearty fellow with no sense of shame. Perhaps he says
    "Sorry;" but he adds, "It must have been on."</p>

    <p>The player who hits everything too gently: the lamb as
    compared with the previous type, who is a lion. The lamb is
    good to play with if you prefer winning to a real contest.</p>

    <p>The player who groans loudly when you make a fluke.</p>

    <p>The player who is accustomed to play on a much faster table
    than this.</p>

    <p>The player who calls the game Pills.</p>

    <p>The player who calls it Tuskers.</p>

    <p>The player who counts your breaks for you, but whether from
    interest or suspicion you are not sure.</p>

    <p>The player who pots the white when he should and says
    nothing about it.</p>

    <p>The player who pots the white when he should, with a
    thousand apologies.</p>

    <p>The player who pots the white when he shouldn't, with a
    thousand apologies.</p>

    <p>The player who is snappy with the marker.</p>

    <p>The player who drops cigar ash on the cloth.</p>

    <p>The player who hates to lose.</p>

    <p>The player who would much rather that you won. This type is
    a joy to play with, unless towards the end he too patently
    ceases to try.</p>

    <p>The player who, after the stroke, tells you what you ought
    to have done.</p>

    <p>The player who talks to the balls, particularly to the red.
    "Now then, red," he says, "don't go into baulk;" or, "Stop just
    by that pocket;" or "White, don't go down."</p>

    <p>The player who has just come from a spectacular match and
    keeps on trying to reproduce that shot of STEVENSON's.</p>

    <h2>CONTRACTS.</h2>

    <p>It was shortly after the commencement of the March offensive
    that it was decided to open new munition works in Glenwhinnie,
    N.B. The contract for building was offered to the well-known
    firm of McTavish, McTurk &amp; McThom, of Auchterinver.</p>

    <p>They accepted. With thanks.</p>

    <p>And so it came about that, early in April, Glenwhinnie, N.B.
    became the scene of great activity. Men bearing strange
    instruments came and took extensive measurements; large bodies
    of gentlemen in corduroys, armed with powerful implements
    indicative of toil, arrived and smoked clay pipes; a special
    light railway was rapidly constructed, and bore colossal cranes
    and more gentlemen with clay pipes to the scene of action. And
    Mr. McTurk went in person to open the proceedings.</p>

    <p>In a speech pulsating with patriotism, Mr. McTurk exhorted
    his men to do their best for their King and country, and show
    everybody what the firm of McTavish, McTurk &amp; McThom could
    do. He then departed, leaving things in the hands of a dozen
    subordinates well tried and true ...</p>

    <p>And so by the early days of June the work began ...</p>

    <p>Came November 11th ...</p>

    <p>November 20th it was decided that the new works in
    Glenwhinnie, N.B., would not be necessary after all.</p>

    <p>What was to be done?</p>

    <p>A special committee decided that the buildings should be
    demolished, and the contract was offered to the well-known firm
    of McClusky, McCleery &amp; McClumpha, of Auchtermuchty.</p>

    <p>They accepted. With thanks.</p>

    <p>And so it came about that a second army of occupation
    descended upon Glenwhinnie, N.B. Fresh bodies of gentlemen in
    corduroys and armed with a rather different set of powerful
    implements arrived, and smoked clay pipes. Another light
    railway was rapidly constructed, and Mr. McCleery went in
    person to open the proceedings. In a speech full of fervour
    ...</p>

    <p>And so by early January the work commenced.</p>

    <p>By this time Messrs. McTavish and Co. had got the buildings
    well in hand. What was to be done? Leave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
       id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> their work uncompleted?
       Never! As Mr. McThom pointed out with considerable emotion
       to his partners, a contract was a contract all the world
       over.</p>

    <p>If it ever came to be said that any firm he was interested
    in had failed to fulfil a contract, he for one (Angus McThom)
    would never hold up his head. The contract must be completed.
    It was a sacred duty. Besides&mdash;a minor point&mdash;what
    about payment?</p>

    <p>So Mr. McTurk was despatched to Glenwhinnie, N.B., where in
    a speech of great power he pointed out the path of duty.</p>

    <p>Amid scenes of enthusiasm the work went on apace.</p>

    <p>And at the other end the well-known firm of McClusky,
    McCleery &amp; McClumpha tore down the buildings with equal
    enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>And that is the state of affairs just now in Glenwhinnie,
    N.B. What will happen when&mdash;as they are bound to
    do&mdash;the wreckers overtake the builders is a matter for
    speculation. Mr. McTurk may make another speech. Possibly Mr.
    McCleery may also exhort. There is promise of a delicate
    situation.</p>

        patient. The scene is laid in</i> Dr. Pillwell's
        <i>consulting-room&mdash;a solid room, heavily furnished. A
        large writing-table occupies the centre of the scene. There
        are a few prints on the walls; two bookcases are solidly
        filled with medical books.</i> Dr. Pillwell <i>is seated at
        the writing-table. He rises to greet his patient.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Dr. P.</i> Good morning, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (<i>He looks
    furtively at a notebook lying open on the table</i>)
    Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Swallow.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. S.</i> (<i>thinking to himself: Ought I to call this
    Johnnie "Doctor," or not? I'm told they're very particular
    about a thing like that. Like a fool, I never gave it a
    thought. Still, I can't go so very far wrong if I call him
    "Doctor." Besides, he's got to be called "Doctor" whether he
    likes it or not. Here goes.</i>) (<i>Aloud</i>) Good morning,
    Dr. Pillwell. I've been troubled with some symptoms which I
    can't quite make out. I think I described them in my letter.
    (<i>To himself: They made several doctors Knights of the
    British Empire, and I'm almost certain Pillwell was one of
    them. Sir John Pillwell. Yes, it sounds all right; but I shan't
    call him "Sir John" because if he isn't a knight he might think
    I was trying to make fun of him and then he might retaliate by
    calling me "Sir Henry," and I should hate that</i>).
    (<i>Aloud</i>) The chief symptoms are a steady loss of appetite
    and a disinclination to work. I was recommended to consult you
    by my friend, Mr. Bolter, as I think I explained in my
    letter.</p>

    <p><i>Dr. P.</i> It's curious how prevalent these symptoms are
    at the present moment. I think, if you don't mind, I will begin
    by taking your temperature.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Produces clinical thermometer and gives it three
        good jerks.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. S.</i> (<i>to himself: There&mdash;I knew he'd want
    to put one of those infernal machines in my mouth. I simply
    loathe the feeling of them, and I'm always on the verge of
    crunching them up. Perhaps I ought to warn him.</i>)
    (<i>Aloud</i>) I'm afraid I'm not much good as a thermometer
    man.</p>

    <p><i>Dr. P.</i> Oh, it's a mere trifle. All you've got to do
    is just to hold it under your tongue. There&mdash;it's in.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. S.</i> (<i>talking with difficulty</i>). Ish i' in 'e
    ri' plashe?</p>

    <p><i>Dr. P.</i> Yes. But don't try to talk while it's in your
    mouth. I've had patients who've bitten it in two.
    There&mdash;that's enough. (<i>Extracts it deftly from
    patient's mouth and examines it.</i>) Hum, hum, yes. A point
    below normal. Nothing violently wrong <i>there</i>. (<i>He now
    performs the usual rites and mysteries.</i>) I'll make you out
    a little prescription which ought to put you all right. And if
    you can spare a week, and spend it at Eastbourne, I don't think
    it will do you any harm.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. S.</i> (<i>To himself: I like this man. He doesn't
    waste any time. It's a curious coincidence that I should have
    been thinking this very morning of arranging a visit to the
    seaside. Now of course I've absolutely got to go. Can't disobey
    my new doctor, and wouldn't if I could. By Jove, I'd all but
    forgotten about the two guineas fee. Yes, the cheque's in my
    breast-pocket. Two guineas for the first visit. The rule is not
    to give it too openly, but to slip it on to a desk or table as
    if you were half ashamed of it. Where shall I put it so as to
    make sure he spots it out of the corner of his eye? Ha! on the
    blotting-pad, which I can just reach. Does it with his left
    hand, and feels a man once more.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>Dr. P.</i> And here's your prescription.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. S.</i> Thank you a thousand times. (<i>To himself:
    He's edging up to the blotting-pad, and he'll have the cheque
    in another second.</i>)</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Finding <i>Midas and Son</i> (METHUEN) described on the
    wrapper as a tale of "the struggle of a young man and his
    immense riches," I said to myself (rather like <i>Triplet</i>
    in the play) that here was a struggle at which it would greatly
    hearten me to assist. As a fact, however, the conflict proved
    to be somewhat postponed; it took Mr. STEPHEN McKENNA more than
    two hundred pages to get the seconds out of the ring and leave
    his hero, <i>Deryk</i>, face to face with an income of
    something over a million a year. Before this happened the youth
    had become engaged to a girl, been thrown over by her,
    experienced the wiles of Circe and gone in more or less vaguely
    for journalism. Then came the income and the question what to
    do with it. Of course he didn't know how to use it to the best
    advantage; it is universal experience that other people never
    do. But <i>Deryk</i> impressed me as more than commonly lacking
    in resource. All he could think of was to finance and share in
    an archæological venture (rather fun), and to purchase a Pall
    Mall club-house&mdash;apparently the R.A.C.&mdash;and do it up
    as a London abode for himself and his old furniture. Also for
    his wife, as fortune had now flung him again into the arms of
    his early love. But it is just here that the subtle and
    slightly cruel cleverness of Mr. McKENNA's scheme becomes
    manifest. The million-a-year had been at work on <i>Deryk</i>;
    it had slain his capacity for romance. In plain words, he found
    that he cared more for his furniture than for his
    <i>fiancée</i>, whose adoration soon bored him to shrieking
    point. So there you are. I shall not betray the author's
    solution of his own problem. I don't think he has proved his
    somewhat obvious point as to the peril of great possessions.
    <i>Deryk</i> was hardly a quite normal subject, and
    <i>Idina</i> (the girl) was a little fool who would have
    irritated a crossing-sweeper. But what he certainly has done is
    to provide some scenes of pre-war London not unworthy to be
    companion pictures to those in <i>Sonia</i>; and this, I fancy,
    will be good enough for most readers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Its publishers call <i>The Pot Boils</i> (CONSTABLE) a
    "provocative" book, and certainly the title at least deserves
    this epithet. But I decline to be drawn into the obvious
    retort. Besides, with all its faults, the story exhibits an
    almost flaunting disregard of those qualities that make the
    best seller. About the author I am prepared to wager, first,
    that "STORM JAMESON" is a disguise; secondly, that the
    personality behind it is feminine. I have hinted that the tale
    is hardly likely to gain universal popularity; let me add that
    certain persons, notably very young Socialists and experts in
    Labour journalism, may find it of absorbing interest. It is a
    young book, almost exclusively about young people, written (or
    I mistake) by a youthful hand. These striplings and maidens are
    all poor, mostly vain, and without exception fulfilled of a
    devastating verbosity. We meet them first at a "Northern
    University," talking, reforming the earth, kissing, and again
    talking&mdash;about the kisses. Thence they and the tale move
    to London, and the same process is repeated. It is all rather
    depressingly narrow in outlook; though within these limits
    there are interesting and even amusing scenes. Also the author
    displays now and again a happy dexterity of phrase (I remember
    one instance&mdash;about "web-footed Socialists ... dividing
    and sub-dividing into committees, like
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"
       id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span> worms cut by a spade"),
       which encourages me to hope that she will do better things
       with a scheme of wider appeal. But to the general,
       especially the middle-aged general, the contents of her
       present <i>Pot</i> will, I fear, be only caviare.</p>

    <p>Little <i>Sara Lee Kennedy</i>, betrothed to one of those
    alert grim-jawed young Americans one sees in the advertising
    pages of <i>The Ladies' Home Journal</i>, learns of the
    suffering in Belgium at the beginning of the great War and
    finds she must do something about it. She can cook, so she will
    go and make soup for KING ALBERT's men. She takes her young
    man's photograph and his surly disapproval; also a few dollars
    hastily collected from her obscure township in Pa.; and becomes
    the good angel of a shattered sector of the Belgian line. And
    she finds in <i>The Amazing Interlude</i> (MURRAY) her
    prince&mdash;a real prince&mdash;in the Secret Service, and,
    after the usual reluctances and brave play (made for the sake
    of deferring the inevitable) with the photograph of the old
    love, is at last gloriously on with the new. It is a very
    charming love-story, and MARY ROBERTS RINEHART makes a much
    better thing of the alarms and excursions of war than you would
    think. It was no good, I found, being superior about it and
    muttering "Sentiment" when you had to blink away the unbidden
    tear lest your fireside partner should find you out. So let me
    commend to you this idealised vision of a corner of the great
    War seen through the eyes of an American woman of vivid
    sympathies.</p>

    <p><i>Rovers of the Night Sky</i> (CASSELL) is for more reasons
    than one a welcome addition to my rapidly bulging collection of
    books about flying. "NIGHT HAWK, M.C.," was in the
    Infantry&mdash;what he calls a "Gravel-Cruncher"&mdash;before
    he took to the air, and by no means the least interesting part
    of his sketches is the way in which he explains the
    co-operation which existed between the fliers and the men
    fighting on the ground. And his delight when a bombing
    expedition was successful in giving instant assistance to the
    Infantry is frequently shown. After his training in England
    "NIGHT HAWK" was attached as an observer to a night-flying
    squadron in France, and he tells us of his adventures with no
    sense of self-importance but with an honest appreciation of
    their value to the general scheme of operations. He has also a
    keen eye for the humours of life, and can make his jest with
    most admirable brevity. "Doubtless," he says in a foreword,
    "the whole world will fly before many years have passed, but
    for the moment most people have to be content to read about
    it." I am one of them, and he has added to my contentment.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>My studies of recent fiction induce the belief that modern
    Wales may be divided into two parts, in one of which the
    inhabitants call each other <i>Bach</i> and follow a code of
    morals that I simply will not stoop to characterise; while the
    other is at once more Saxon in idiom and considerably more
    melodramatic in its happenings. It is to the latter province
    that I must assign <i>A Little Welsh Girl</i> (HODDER AND
    STOUGHTON), the Romance, with a big R, of <i>Dylis Morgan</i>,
    who pushed an unappreciated suitor over a precipice and came to
    London to make her fortune in revue. Really the suitor didn't
    go all the way down the precipice; but as, by the time he
    recovered, <i>Dylis</i>, disguised, had fled for England, he
    was promptly arrested for her murder, and as <i>Dylis</i>
    thought she had murdered him there was presently so much
    confusion (increased for me by the hopelessly unpronounceable
    names of a large cast) that I found it increasingly hard to
    keep the affair in hand. As for <i>Dylis's</i> theatrical
    career&mdash;well, you know how these things are managed in
    fiction; for my part I was left wondering whether Mr. HOWEL
    EVANS' pictures of Wales were as romantically conceived as his
    conception of a West-End theatre. Though of course we all know
    that Welsh people do sometimes make even more sensational
    triumphs in the Metropolis; just possible indeed that this fact
    may have some bearing on the recent flood of Cambrian fiction.
    Certainly, if <i>A Little Welsh Girl</i> achieves success on
    the strength of Mr. LLOYD GEORGE's triumph, she may thank her
    luck, for I have my doubts whether she could manage it
    unassisted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Of <i>Ladies Must Live</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) one may
    say, in the first place, that it is fortunately unnecessary as
    well as unusual for the bulk of them to live in the scalp and
    tomahawk atmosphere that distinguishes the sexual and social
    rivalry of <i>Christine Fennimer</i> and <i>Nancy Almar</i>,
    the two beautiful American Society dames whose duel for the
    affections of the eligible hero form the plot, the whole plot
    and nothing but the plot of Miss ALICE DUER MILLER's latest
    book. Nature red in tooth and claw has not mothered
    them&mdash;they are too well-bred for that; they simply bite
    with their tongues. <i>Mrs. Almar</i>, who is married and
    purely piratical, comes off worst in the encounter, and the
    more artful <i>Christine</i>, ultimately falling in love with
    the object of her artifices, becomes human enough to marry him,
    despite his lapse from financial eligibility. The plot is a
    thin one, but smoothly and brightly unfolded. Unhappily Miss
    MILLER lacks the gift of delicate satire and the sense of
    humour that the society novel above all others seems to
    require. With a lighter and less matter-of-fact treatment one
    would accept more easily the overdrawing of her rather
    impossible felines.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
